Dynamic Web Report B is an enhancement of the original Gramps Dynamic Web Report

The document _Dynamic Web Report B.pdf_ describes what it does.  In short it has:

- **Timeline Events**:  The event tab for a person is a timeline of theit own events plus vital events (births and deaths) of their siblings, parents, children and spouses.  Tickboxes let you filter out various events.

- **Tracking**:  One or more people in your tree can be tagged, and then the relationship of each person in the report is tracked back to these people, eg whether they are a great aunt, or cousin etc.  This shows in the person header.

- **Why Me**: Someone is in your tree for a reason.  the Why Me box explains why.  It is filled from a note attached to that person.  It shows in the person header.

- **Story**:  Every person can have a Story note attached to them, which shows in the person header.

- **Multiple Family clarity**:  I could not see when looking at the Ancestors and Descendants tabs how multiple families were relevant to a person.  There is now a bit more data exposed to help with that.

- **Local labels**:  you can change any label on the report, just from the contents of a note.  For example, I can change ‘Ancestors’ to ‘Parents and Siblings’.  I think this works with other languages (I have briefly tested with French).  

There are some other changes as well, described in the attached pdf.
